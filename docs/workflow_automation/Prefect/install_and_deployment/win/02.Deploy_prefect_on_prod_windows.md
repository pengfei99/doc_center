# Deploy prefect on prod on windows

In this doc, we will show how to deploy `Prefect` on production on a Windows server.

There is an official doc [here](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/how-to-guides/self-hosted/server-windows). But I found it
lack of many things.

## Pre-deployment checklist

Before the deployment steps, make sure you have the below items.

1. Windows server admin access
2. The right python interpreter version(3.11 or 3.12)
3. The `Prefect` python wheel package
4. The postgresql-15 server (or higher) .
5. Prefect uses the [pg_trgm](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html) extension, so it must be installed
   and enabled on the postgresql server.

## Deployment steps

The below list shows the general `Prefect` deployment steps:

1. Create Service account for `security isolation`, `continuous uptime` and better `auditing`.
2. Install postgresql server with `pg_trgm` extension.(Dedicated service account to run postgresql)
3. Install python interpreter. (Dedicated service account to run Prefect)
4. Create virtual env, and install the prefect python package.
5. Configure and run prefect api server(setup server `data, log, conf dir` with env var, postgresql connection config)
6. Create a `work-pool` and run a `simple workflow`
7. Create a window service which runs the `Prefect Orion api server` and `worker` process.
8. Launch the `Prefect` service.
9. Login with a user account, try to register a workflow and run it. check the output, and the task logs, etc..

## 1. Create service account.

We suppose the service account name which runs the prefect service is called `svc_prefect`. The postgresql server
installer will
create a service account automatically. So we only create `svc_prefect` here.

```powershell
# 1. Create local account
New-LocalUser -Name "svc_prefect" -Password (Read-Host -AsSecureString "Enter password") -Description "Prefect service account"

# 2. Add 'Log on as a service' right
$account = "svc_prefect"
# export current local security policy into a plaintext configuration file (C:\secpol.cfg)
secedit /export /cfg C:\secpol.cfg
# modify the security policy by adding `*S-1-5-32-544`(the SID for the local Administrators group.)
(gc C:\secpol.cfg).Replace("SeServiceLogonRight =", "SeServiceLogonRight = *S-1-5-32-544,$account") | Out-File C:\secpol.cfg
# after the above commands, in secpol.cfg, you should see the below lines
# SeServiceLogonRight = *S-1-5-32-544,svc_prefect

# import the modified security policy
secedit /import /cfg C:\secpol.cfg /db secedit.sdb
# Apply the policy immediately
gpupdate /force
# delete the temprary file
Remove-Item C:\secpol.cfg

# 3. Grant permissions
icacls D:\prefect_data /grant "svc_prefect:(OI)(CI)F"

# 4. If you also want to use it interactively (to open a shell session and install Python package):
net localgroup "Administrators" svc_prefect /add
# You need to remove it later after installation for security hardening.
net localgroup "Administrators" svc_prefect /delete
```

## 2. Install postgresql server on windows

Prepare two directories to store the DB data and logs

```powershell
mkdir "D:\pgsql\data"
mkdir "D:\pgsql\logs"
```

> Replace the `D:` by a suitable `non-system drive` (D: or E:) for production.
> Ensure only the `PostgreSQL service account and Administrators` have modify rights:
>
Below commands show an example of ACL setup.

```powershell
icacls D:\pgsql /inheritance:r /grant "Administrators:(OI)(CI)F" /grant "NT SERVICE\PostgreSQL:(OI)(CI)M"
```

### 2.1 Use EnterpriseDB installer (recommended)

1. Download the Windows installer matching your architecture (e.g., `postgresql-16-windows-x64.exe`).

2. Run it in **Administrator mode**.

3. Server config:
    - Installation directory: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16
    - Data directory: D:\pgsql\data
    - Password: secure password for the postgres user
    - Port: 5432
    - Locale: default or en_US.UTF-8

4. Check the generated service
    - The installer automatically creates and registers the Windows service: `PostgreSQL Database Server 16` with
      startup type Automatic.
    - Verify the service: `Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*postgres*"}`

### 2.2 Configure postgresql for production

Edit `D:\pgsql\data\postgresql.conf`:

```ini
listen_addresses = 'localhost'
port = 5432
logging_collector = on
log_directory = 'D:/pgsql/logs'
log_filename = 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d.log'
```

Edit `D:\pgsql\data\pg_hba.conf` to restrict access:

```powershell
# TYPE  DATABASE  USER      ADDRESS         METHOD
local   all       all                        scram-sha-256
host    prefect_db  prefect  127.0.0.1/32    scram-sha-256
```

Restart the service to apply the new conf

```powershell
net stop postgresql
net start postgresql
```

> Check with Eric, why postgres use outdated `net` command, not the modern `sc` command.

### 2.3 Create Prefect database and user

```powershell
# start a psql shell
cd "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin"
.\psql -U postgres

# run the below command to create prefect db and user
CREATE DATABASE prefect_db;
CREATE USER prefect WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'prefect_pass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE prefect_db TO prefect;

# check the connexion
.\psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U prefect_user -d prefect_db
```

> Add the Prefect db connection string within `Prefect service account` :
`setx /M PREFECT_API_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL "postgresql+asyncpg://prefect_id:prefect_pass@localhost:5432/prefect_db"`

> if you have permission issue on public Schema, you may need to change the owner of the `prefect_db` to `prefect`

```powershell
# close all connexion
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = 'prefect_db';

# change ownership of db
ALTER DATABASE prefect_db OWNER TO prefect_user;

# change ownership of schema
\c prefect_db

ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO prefect_user;

# fix default privilege for future tables
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLES TO prefect_user;

# grant all permisision
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE prefect_db TO prefect_user;
```

You can initiate the prefect service database schema with the below command

```powershell
prefect server database upgrade
```

> Don't forget to activate your virtual env first.

### 2.4 Verify postgres service during Prefect launch

```powershell
# check service status
Get-Service postgresql

# view db log
Get-Content "D:\pgsql\logs\server.log" -Tail 20
```

### 2.5 Enable pg_trgm extension

```powershell
# get a psql shell
cd "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin"
psql -U postgres -d prefect_db

# enable the extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;

# check the installation
\dx

# expected output
List of installed extensions
Name    | Version | Schema |                   Description
-----------+---------+--------+-----------------------------------------------
pg_trgm   | 1.9     | public | text similarity measurement and index searching

```

> The extension is enabled per database, so you must run it in every database where you want trigram indexes.

### 2.6. Tuning the postgres server (optional)

If you need to increase the postgres server performance, you can edit the below params in `postgresql.conf`.

```powershell
shared_buffers = 2GB
work_mem = 64MB
maintenance_work_mem = 512MB
max_connections = 50
wal_level = replica
checkpoint_timeout = 15min

```

## 3. Install the python interpreter

Should have conda installed in the Windows server.

## 4. Create virtual env, and install the prefect python package.

The below commands should run under the `svc_prefect` service account.

### 4.1 Open a shell as svc_prefect service account

```powershell
# open a shell as svc_prefect with runas
runas /user:svc_prefect cmd

# check the current user
whoami
# Expected output:
myserver\svc_prefect
```

> Now all actions (venv creation, python package install) happen inside this account’s profile.
>

### 4.2 Create a python virtual env

```powershell
# create a virtual env
conda create --name prefect_env python --offline

conda activate prefect_env

# install prefect
pip install prefect==3.4.25

# after installation, check prefect
prefect version

# get python path
where python

# get prefect executable path
where prefect
```

> The current(25/10/2025) stable version is `3.4.25`.
>

## 5. Configure and run prefect api server

The way on how to configure `Prefect` is quite `different between v2.0 and v3.0`. So check which version of Prefect that
you are using before you follow the below doc. The below doc is only for `Prefect 3.0 and above`.

You can visit the official [website](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/concepts/settings-and-profiles) for more details.

Prefect provides three level of configuration:

- **system level**: System Environment variables
- user level: Active profile settings
- project level: `.env, prefect.toml, and pyproject.toml file` in the curring working directory(project folder).

When multiple settings sources define the same setting, Prefect follows the precedence order (highest to lowest):

1. Environment variables `(Highest priority)`
2. .env file in the current working directory
3. prefect.toml file in the current working directory
4. pyproject.toml file in the current working directory
5. Active profile settings
6. Default values `(Lowest priority)`

> For example, if you set `PREFECT_API_URL` in both your environment and your active profile, the environment variable
> value will take precedence.

### 5.1 Prefect configuration with System Environment variables

All Prefect settings can be set using environment variables prefixed with `PREFECT_`. They **take precedence over all
other sources**, making them ideal for adjustments that should only apply to a single session or process.

In this tutorial, as we plan to deploy the `Prefect` server for all users, the best way to configure `Prefect` is to
use `System Environment variables`.

For example, the below setting are

```powershell
setx /M PREFECT_HOME "D:\prefect_data"
setx /M PREFECT_API_URL "http://localhost:4200/api"
setx /M PREFECT_API_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL "postgresql+asyncpg://prefect_id:prefect_pass@localhost:5432/prefect_db"
```

> /M option means machine Machine-level environment variables
> Ensure `D:\prefect_data` is writable by `svc_prefect`:

```powershell
icacls D:\prefect_data /grant "svc_prefect:(OI)(CI)M"
```

### 5.2 Prefect configuration with project level configuration files

`Prefect 3.0` supports three types of configuration files:.

- .env
- prefect.toml
- pyproject.toml

#### 5.2.1 .env file

`.env files` are useful for declaring local settings that you want to apply across multiple runs.
When running prefect in a directory that contains a .env file,
`Prefect will automatically apply the settings in the file`.
We recommend keeping your .env files local and not committing them to your code repositories.

For example, the following `.env file` declares a local setting for the logging level:

```dotenv
PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

> Any flows run in the same directory as this .env file will use the DEBUG logging level, even if they are run in
> different shell sessions.

#### 5.2.2 prefect.toml file

A prefect.toml file is useful when you want to declare settings for an entire project.

You can keep a `prefect.toml file in your project directory` and the declared settings will be automatically
applied when running prefect in that directory. We recommend committing this file to your code repositories to
ensure consistency across environments.

Example of the `prefect.toml`

```toml
[api]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:4200/api"

[server]
loggin_level = "INFO"
analytics_enabled = "False"
deployment_schedule_max_scheduled_runs = 20
database.connection_url = "postgresql+asyncpg://prefect_user:your_secure_password@localhost:5432/prefect_db"


```

#### 5.2.3 pyproject.toml file

Declaring settings in a `pyproject.toml` file is very similar to declaring settings in a `prefect.toml` file. The
main difference is that `settings are declared in the [tool.prefect]` table instead of at the root of the file.

For example, the following pyproject.toml file declares a setting for the logging level:

```toml
[tool.prefect]
logging.level = "DEBUG"

```

> The advantage of declaring settings in a pyproject.toml file is that it allows you to keep all your dependencies and
> settings for all your tools in one place.

### 5.3 Prefect configuration with profiles

Prefect profiles are useful for switching between different environments. By creating different profiles with
different API URLs, you can easily switch between a local Prefect server and your production environment.

`Profiles` are stored in a TOML file located at `~/.prefect/profiles.toml` by default. This location can be
configured by setting `PREFECT_PROFILES_PATH`.

You can configure prefect with the `prefect profile CLI commands`, or edit the `profiles.toml` file directly.

The `prefect profile CLI commands` enable you to `create, review, and manage profiles`:

| Command           | Description                                                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| create            | Create a new profile; use the --from flag to copy settings from another profile. |
| delete            | Delete the given profile.                                                        |
| inspect           | Display settings from a given profile; defaults to active.                       |
| ls                | List all profile names.                                                          |
| rename            | Change the name of a profile.                                                    |
| use               | Switch the active profile.                                                       |
| populate-defaults | Populate your profiles.toml file with opinionated stock profiles.                |

For example, the following CLI commands set configuration in the ephemeral profile and then create a new profile 
with new settings:

```bash
prefect profile use ephemeral
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api

prefect profile create new-profile --from ephemeral
prefect profile use new-profile
prefect config set PREFECT_RESULTS_PERSIST_BY_DEFAULT=true PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL="ERROR"

prefect profile inspect
prefect config unset PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL -y
```

### 5.4 Verify the configuration values.

If you are not sure which are the current config values, you can use the below command to check

```powershell
# print all available settings and their active value
prefect config view --show-defaults

# check the validity of the config
prefect config validate

# change current setting values (general form)
prefect config set <setting>=<value>

# for example
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api

# restore default value(general form)
prefect config unset <setting>

# for example
prefect config unset PREFECT_API_URL

```

### 5.5 Common server setting

No matter which methods you use to configure the `Prefect` server. The minimum configuration are

```dotenv
PREFECT_HOME="D:\prefect_data"
PREFECT_API_URL="http://localhost:4200/api"
PREFECT_API_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://prefect_id:prefect_pass@localhost:5432/prefect_db"
```

### 5.6 Start the prefect server manually

For testing purpose, we can run the prefect server with the below command

```powershell
# upgrade or init the database
prefect server database upgrade

# start prefect server
prefect server start
```

After the above command, you will have two services:

- **API**: runs on http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
- **Web UI**: runs on http://127.0.0.1:4200

> Leave this PowerShell window open
>

## 6. Create a work-pool and run a simple workflow

### 6.1 Create a work-pool

```powershell
# create a work-pool
prefect work-pool create local-pool --type process

# start a worker which takes flow from a pool
prefect worker start --pool local-pool
```

### 6.2 Create a simple workflow

You can save the below script in a directory. In my case, I put it under `./flows/pengfei/simple_flow.py`

> The directory `flows/pengfei` should be accessible by admin and user pengfei.

```python
from prefect import flow, task, get_run_logger


@task(log_prints=True)
def extract():
    data = [1, 2, 3]
    msg = f"Task1: Extracting data: {data}"
    logger = get_run_logger()
    logger.info(msg)
    print(msg)
    return data


@task(log_prints=True)
def transform(data):
    print(f"Task2: Transforming data: {data}")
    return [x * 10 for x in data]


@task(log_prints=True)
def load(data):
    print(f"Task3: Loading result {data}")


@flow
def etl_flow():
    # task 1
    data = extract()
    # task 2
    clean = transform(data)
    # task 3
    load(clean)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    etl_flow()
```

> This script uses both the print and logger to print info in the task logs
>
You can run a workflow directly with the below command

```powershell
python ./flows/pengfei/simple_flow.py
```

## 7. Create a window service for Prefect

### 7.1 Create `Prefect` service startup scripts

Use the service manager of CASD? Check with Eric 

Create a server startup script under `D:\prefect_data\scripts\start_server.ps1`

```powershell
$env:PREFECT_HOME = "D:\prefect_data"
$env:PREFECT_API_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING = "postgresql+psycopg2://prefect:prefect_pass@localhost:5432/prefect_db"
$env:PREFECT_LOGGING_SERVER_LEVEL = "INFO"
& "C:\Users\svc_prefect\prefect-env\Scripts\prefect.exe" orion start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200

```

Create a worker startup script under `D:\prefect_data\scripts\start_worker.ps1`

```powershell
$env:PREFECT_HOME = "D:\prefect_data"
$env:PREFECT_API_URL = "http://localhost:4200/api"
& "C:\Users\svc_prefect\prefect-env\Scripts\prefect.exe" worker start --pool shared_pool
```

Create `Windows Services` via **sc.exe**.

```powershell
# create service for server
sc create PrefectServer binPath= "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File D:\prefect_data\scripts\start_server.ps1" start= auto obj= ".\svc_prefect" password= "StrongPwd!"

# create service for worker
sc create PrefectWorker binPath= "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File D:\prefect_data\scripts\start_worker.ps1" start= auto obj= ".\svc_prefect" password= "StrongPwd!"

# check the created service
sc query PrefectServer
sc query PrefectWorker

# configure recovery and description
sc failure PrefectServer reset= 86400 actions= restart/5000
sc failure PrefectWorker reset= 86400 actions= restart/5000
sc description PrefectServer "Prefect 3 Server API Service"
sc description PrefectWorker "Prefect 3 Worker Service"
```

> To delete a service, we can use `sc delete <service-name>`

## 8. Launch the prefect service

```powershell

# start the service
sc start PrefectServer
sc start PrefectWorker

```

> Now you can check the Prefect Web UI: `http://localhost:4200`.

Some useful commands for managing the services

```powershell
# Start server	
sc start PrefectServer

# Stop Server	
sc stop PrefectServer

# Restart Worker	
sc stop PrefectWorker && sc start PrefectWorker

# View server status	
sc query PrefectServer

# View logs	
Event Viewer → Windows Logs → Application
```

## 9. Use a user account to test the Prefect server
