# Install python on debian

Unlike ubuntu, debian does not provide a python interpreter by default. So we need to install it by ourself.

In this tutorial, we will build the python from source

## Get the python source

You can download the python source from their official [site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

For example, I download the 3.10.7 with below command

```shell
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.7/Python-3.10.7.tgz

tar -xzvf Python-3.10.7.tgz
```

## Build from source

```shell
cd Python-3.10.7

# setup configure
./configure --enable-optimizations

# start the build
# The value  -j 2 represents the number of CPU cores that can be used  
sudo make -j 2

# Check it with nproc command.
nproc
# it should returns 2

# install the binary
sudo make altinstall

# if everythin works well. You should be able to run
python3 -V
Python 3.10.7
```

The `-–enable-optimizations` flag optimizes the Python binary and executes multiple tests.

## Upgrade pip and install package

```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install <module_name>
```
