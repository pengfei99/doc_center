# 5. Storage in k8s (Storage class with CephFS)

The official doc of k8s is [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/). In this documentation, we only covers:
- Storage class: Allow PV to use physique device to allocate volume dynamically
- Persistent Volume (PV): PV is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using `Storage Classes`. **Note a PV is not directly linked to a pod.** A Pod will request a `PVC(Persistent volume claim)` which will consume a PV.
- Persistent Volume Claim (PVC): PVC is a request for storage by a user (Pod). PVCs consume PV resources. PVCs can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany or ReadWriteMany, see AccessModes).


**This step is essential** for Onyxia to work properly. Most of the services in Onyxia require storage (`persistent volume`). They are all provisioned dynamically by using `StorageClass`. As a result we need to create a **storage class** in the k8s cluster.

## CephFs Installation

You need to follow this [doc](../adminsys/fs/Rook_Ceph/rook_ceph_Installation.md) to install ceph file system.
