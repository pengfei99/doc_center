# Install minio client

**Minio client** (mc) is a command line tool that allows you to manage your s3 projects. The official documentation for its installation is [here](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide)

## Install the binary
Below commands help you to install it on your local environment.

```shell
# download the binary
wget https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc

# give the execution right
chmod +x mc

# move it to right place
mv mc ~/.local/bin

# make sure ~/.local/bin is in your path
```

Or you can use [minio_client_install.sh](../../resources/minio/k8s/minio_client_install.sh)


## Setup a connection alias

Now we need to setup a connection alias for the minio client

```shell
# the general form is:
mc alias set <ALIAS> <YOUR-S3-ENDPOINT> <YOUR-ACCESS-KEY> <YOUR-SECRET-KEY> --api <API-SIGNATURE>

# for example:
mc --insecue alias set s3 https://minio.casd.local minio mypwd --api S3v4
```

## MC Common commands

```shell
# list all objects in a given bucket
mc ls s3/<bucket-name>

# delete
```

## Setup an admin connection

The `minio client (mc)` also provide commands for performing administrative tasks on your MinIO deployments. While mc supports any S3-compatible service, `mc admin only supports MinIO deployments`.

You can find the official doc [here](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc-admin.html)

Below command will add an admin host alias

 If the minio server certiifcat is self signed, you can use option **--insecure** to ignore certificat related errors.

```shell
# the general form is:
mc config host add <ALIAS> <ENDPOINT> <ACCESS_KEY> <SECRET_KEY>

mc config host add admin-s3 http://minio.casd.local minio mypwd --api S3v4
```

## MC Admin common commands

```shell
# displays the information of a minio server.
mc admin info admin-s3
```
